## üîÑ Integration Points

### SDK Manager Integration
All services now properly integrate with the centralized SDK manager:

```python
from app.services.zoho_sdk_manager import get_sdk_manager

# Standard pattern across all services
def __init__(self):
    self.sdk_manager = get_sdk_manager()
    if not self.sdk_manager.is_initialized():
        # Handle initialization or log appropriate warnings
```

### Response Transformation
Consistent use of SDK response transformer across all services:

```python
from app.services.sdk_response_transformer import get_response_transformer

transformer = get_response_transformer()
pipeline_response = transformer.transform_records_response(sdk_response)
```

### Unified CRM Service Usage
Standardized usage of the unified CRM service:

```python
from app.services.zoho_crm.unified_crm_service import UnifiedCRMService

crm_service = UnifiedCRMService()
deals_response = await crm_service.get_deals(per_page=100)
```
