# Business Requirements Document (BRD) - Pipeline Pulse

## 1. Introduction

The Pipeline Pulse project aims to transform raw Zoho CRM data into actionable insights, providing revenue leaders with real-time pipeline intelligence. This document outlines the business needs, project goals, and comprehensive functional requirements from a business perspective.

## 2. Business Need

Current sales pipeline analysis often relies on manual data extraction and static reports, leading to outdated insights, delayed decision-making, and a lack of real-time visibility into sales performance and potential bottlenecks. There is a critical need for an automated, real-time system that integrates directly with Zoho CRM, standardizes data, and provides dynamic, actionable insights.

### Key Business Challenges

- **Data Fragmentation**: Sales data scattered across multiple systems and formats
- **Currency Inconsistency**: Global team entering deals in local currencies without standardized SGD conversion
- **Limited Visibility**: No real-time tracking of opportunity progression through revenue realization
- **Manual Processes**: Time-consuming data preparation and report generation
- **Reactive Management**: Inability to proactively identify at-risk deals or expansion opportunities

## 3. Project Goals

- **Automate Data Ingestion**: Establish a robust, automated process for synchronizing sales data from Zoho CRM into the Pipeline Pulse system
- **Provide Real-time Visibility**: Enable users to view up-to-the-minute sales pipeline data and key performance indicators
- **Enhance Data Quality & Consistency**: Ensure data accuracy, standardize currency to SGD, and identify discrepancies between CRM and the analytical system
- **Improve Operational Efficiency**: Reduce manual effort in data preparation and reporting, allowing sales operations and leadership to focus on strategic analysis
- **Facilitate Proactive Issue Resolution**: Provide tools for monitoring sync health, identifying conflicts, and enabling timely resolution of data discrepancies
- **Enable Revenue Intelligence**: Transform opportunity data into predictive insights for revenue forecasting and risk management
- **Support GTM Strategy**: Align system capabilities with 1CloudHub's Go-to-Market motion tracking requirements

## 4. Scope
