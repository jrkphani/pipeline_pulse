# Design & UI/UX Guidelines

This document outlines the design principles and UI/UX guidelines for the Pipeline Pulse application. Adhering to these guidelines will ensure a consistent, intuitive, and high-quality user experience.

## 1. Core Principles

-   **Clarity over Clutter:** Every element on the screen should have a clear purpose. Avoid unnecessary information or visual noise.
-   **Consistency is Key:** Components, layouts, and interactions should be consistent throughout the application. A user should be able to predict how a component will behave based on their experience in other parts of the app.
-   **Efficiency and Speed:** The UI should be fast and responsive. Users are here to accomplish tasks quickly; the design should facilitate that, not hinder it.
-   **Accessibility First:** The application must be usable by everyone, including people with disabilities. We will adhere to WCAG 2.1 AA standards.

## 2. Visual Style & Branding

-   **Component Library:** We use **shadcn/ui**. All new UI components should be built using this library to maintain visual consistency. Do not introduce new, one-off styles without a strong reason.
-   **Color Palette:** The color scheme is defined in `frontend/src/index.css` and `tailwind.config.js`. Use the defined color variables (e.g., `bg-primary`, `text-destructive`).
-   **Typography:** The primary font is **Inter**. Use the defined text styles (e.g., `text-lg`, `font-semibold`) to maintain a consistent typographic hierarchy.
-   **Iconography:** We use **Lucide React** for icons. Use icons purposefully to enhance understanding, not for decoration.

## 3. Layout and Structure

-   **Responsive Design:** All pages must be fully responsive and functional on screen sizes from mobile (320px) to large desktops.
-   **Consistent Layout:** Most pages should follow the standard `AppLayout` structure, which includes the sidebar and header. This provides a consistent navigation experience.
-   **Spacing:** Use the spacing variables defined in the Tailwind configuration for consistent margins, padding, and gaps.

## 4. User Interaction

-   **Feedback:** Provide immediate feedback for user actions. Use loading spinners for asynchronous operations, and toasts (`sonner`) for success or error messages.
-   **State Management:** Use the `zustand` stores (`useUIStore`, `useAppStore`) to manage global UI state, such as filters or theme, to ensure a persistent and predictable user experience.
-   **Keyboard Navigation:** All interactive elements must be reachable and operable via the keyboard. Follow logical tab order.

## 5. Accessibility

-   **Semantic HTML:** Use appropriate HTML tags (`<nav>`, `<main>`, `<button>`, etc.) to provide meaning to screen readers.
-   **ARIA Attributes:** Use ARIA attributes where necessary to improve accessibility, especially for complex components.
-   **Labels:** All form inputs must have associated `<label>` tags.
-   **Alternative Text:** All images must have descriptive `alt` text.
