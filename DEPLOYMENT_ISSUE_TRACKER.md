## üö® **CRITICAL ISSUES**

### Issue #1: Old Infrastructure Still Serving Authentication
**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED  
**Severity**: Critical  
**Category**: Infrastructure/DNS

**Problem**: 
- Application Load Balancer was serving old authentication-enabled backend
- No ECS clusters found, but ALB was still responding
- Users still seeing "Sign in with Zoho" buttons

**Root Cause**: 
- ALB pointing to unknown/orphaned infrastructure
- CloudFront cache serving stale content
- Old infrastructure not properly cleaned up

**Resolution**:
1. Created completely new ECS cluster: `pipeline-pulse-direct-access`
2. Built new ALB: `pipeline-pulse-direct-access-alb-1164616394.ap-southeast-1.elb.amazonaws.com`
3. Updated DNS records to point to new infrastructure
4. Invalidated CloudFront cache multiple times

**Prevention**: Always verify infrastructure state before deployment

---

### Issue #2: Docker Platform Architecture Mismatch
**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED  
**Severity**: High  
**Category**: Docker/ECS

**Problem**:
- ECS tasks failing with: "exec /usr/local/bin/python: exec format error"
- Tasks stopping immediately after start

**Root Cause**:
- Docker image built on ARM64 (Apple Silicon) but ECS Fargate requires AMD64
- Platform architecture not specified during build

**Resolution**:
```bash
# Fixed with explicit platform specification
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t pipeline-pulse-direct-access:latest .
```

**Prevention**: Always specify `--platform linux/amd64` for AWS deployments

---

### Issue #3: VPC Network Isolation - Database Connectivity
**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED  
**Severity**: High  
**Category**: Networking/Security

**Problem**:
- Database connection timeout: "connection to server at pipeline-pulse-db-dev.c39du3coqgj0.ap-southeast-1.rds.amazonaws.com port 5432 failed: timeout expired"
- Health checks returning 503 Service Unavailable

**Root Cause**:
- ECS service deployed in default VPC (`vpc-e2468385`)
- Database located in different VPC (`vpc-0ce689a64c180be51`)
- Security groups not allowing cross-VPC communication

**Resolution**:
1. Created new security group in database VPC: `sg-002e6735930a3d8e1`
2. Updated ECS service network configuration to use database VPC subnets
3. Added security group rule allowing ECS ‚Üí Database communication
```bash
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress --group-id sg-0eca52a0e07bf8500 --protocol tcp --port 5432 --source-group sg-002e6735930a3d8e1
```

**Prevention**: Always deploy services in same VPC as dependencies

---

### Issue #4: Database Authentication Failure
**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED  
**Severity**: High  
**Category**: Database/Secrets

**Problem**:
- "password authentication failed for user 'postgres'"
- Application connecting but wrong credentials

**Root Cause**:
- AWS Secrets Manager contained password `pipeline123`
- Actual database password was different
- Password mismatch between secret and RDS instance

**Resolution**:
```bash
# Updated RDS master password to match secret
aws rds modify-db-instance --db-instance-identifier pipeline-pulse-db-dev --master-user-password pipeline123 --apply-immediately
```

**Prevention**: Ensure secrets and database passwords are synchronized

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **MEDIUM ISSUES**

### Issue #5: AWS Secrets Manager Permission Errors
**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED  
**Severity**: Medium  
**Category**: IAM/Permissions

**Problem**:
- ECS tasks failing to start with secrets retrieval errors
- "User is not authorized to perform: secretsmanager:GetSecretValue"

**Root Cause**:
- Task execution role missing Secrets Manager permissions
- Incorrect secret ARN format in task definition

**Resolution**:
1. Created dedicated IAM policy for Secrets Manager access
2. Attached policy to both task role and execution role
3. Updated task definition with correct secret ARN format

**Prevention**: Always test IAM permissions before deployment

---

### Issue #6: CloudWatch Log Group Missing
**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED  
**Severity**: Medium  
**Category**: Logging

**Problem**:
- ECS tasks failing to start due to missing log group
- No application logs available for debugging

**Root Cause**:
- Log group `/ecs/pipeline-pulse-direct-access` didn't exist
- ECS task definition referenced non-existent log group

**Resolution**:
```bash
aws logs create-log-group --log-group-name /ecs/pipeline-pulse-direct-access
```

**Prevention**: Create log groups before deploying ECS services

---

### Issue #7: TypeScript Build Errors
**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED  
**Severity**: Medium  
**Category**: Frontend Build

**Problem**:
- Frontend build failing with TypeScript errors
- `Parameter 'data' implicitly has an 'any' type`

**Root Cause**:
- Missing type annotations in React Query callback
- Strict TypeScript configuration

**Resolution**:
```typescript
// Fixed type annotation
refetchInterval: (data: any) => {
  return data?.batch_details?.sync_status === 'syncing' ? 3000 : false;
},
```

**Prevention**: Use proper TypeScript types throughout codebase

---

## üîß **MINOR ISSUES**

### Issue #8: ALB Target Group Health Check Timeout
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è ONGOING  
**Severity**: Low  
**Category**: Load Balancer

**Problem**:
- Target group showing targets as "unhealthy" due to timeout
- Application responding correctly but ALB health check failing

**Root Cause**:
- ALB health check timeout configuration
- Possible network latency issues

**Current Status**: Application working, investigating ALB configuration

---

### Issue #9: CloudFront Cache Invalidation Delays
**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED  
**Severity**: Low  
**Category**: CDN

**Problem**:
- Frontend changes not immediately visible
- Old authentication components still showing

**Root Cause**:
- CloudFront cache not immediately invalidated
- Browser caching of JavaScript bundles

**Resolution**:
1. Multiple cache invalidations with `/*` pattern
2. Rebuilt frontend with new hash values
3. Used cache-busting query parameters for testing

**Prevention**: Always invalidate cache after deployments

## üéØ **LESSONS LEARNED**

### 1. **Infrastructure Verification**
Always verify existing infrastructure state before starting deployments. Orphaned resources can cause confusion and deployment failures.

### 2. **Platform Consistency**
Docker images must be built for the target platform. Use `--platform linux/amd64` for AWS deployments.

### 3. **Network Architecture**
Deploy all related services in the same VPC to avoid connectivity issues. Plan network topology before deployment.

### 4. **Secrets Management**
Ensure secrets and actual service configurations are synchronized. Test database connectivity with actual credentials.

### 5. **Incremental Deployment**
Create new infrastructure alongside old rather than modifying in-place. This allows for easier rollback and comparison.

### 6. **Comprehensive Testing**
Test each component individually before integration. Verify health endpoints, database connections, and API responses.

- [ ] Test Docker image on target platform
- [ ] Create CloudWatch log groups
- [ ] Verify IAM permissions

### Deployment Steps
1. **Create Infrastructure**: New cluster, ALB, security groups
2. **Build & Test Image**: With correct platform specification
3. **Deploy & Monitor**: Watch logs and health checks
4. **Update DNS**: Point to new infrastructure
5. **Validate**: Test all endpoints and functionality
6. **Cleanup**: Remove old infrastructure after validation

### Post-Deployment

## üìû **EMERGENCY CONTACTS & ROLLBACK**

### Rollback Procedure
If issues arise, rollback by:
1. Reverting DNS changes in Route 53
2. Pointing CloudFront back to old origins
3. Scaling down new ECS service
4. Investigating issues in isolated environment

### Key AWS Resources
- **New ECS Cluster**: `pipeline-pulse-direct-access`
- **New ALB**: `pipeline-pulse-direct-access-alb-1164616394.ap-southeast-1.elb.amazonaws.com`
- **Database**: `pipeline-pulse-db-dev.c39du3coqgj0.ap-southeast-1.rds.amazonaws.com`
- **Secrets**: `pipeline-pulse/app-secrets`
